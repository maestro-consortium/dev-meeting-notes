### News

- First CoreDevs meeting

### Technical discussions

- [name=Joris] How to split main library/bindings build (coal PR #658)
    - how to ease the build of projects and Python bindings
    - 3 approaches
        - "if" in cmakefiles
        - in the same repo, split cmakelist with with project/sub-project which can be activated or compiled separately (slight more complex). Issue with jrl-cmakemodules.
        - have 2 repositories (involves a lot of work)
    - 2 POCs currently (approaches 1 & 2), ongoing
