### News

 - [name=Pierre-Guillaume] CNRS PUMA submissions under review. Official announcement expected end of August (vacations)

### Technical discussions

 - [name=Joris] Remove codacy ?
     - ok for Python, but problematic for C++. Ruff would be better for Python? (potentially https://mypy-lang.org/ but pb with old code related/visualizer/meshcat/hpp-fcl, lack of typing)
     - Clang-tidy ? Lots of false positive in the pinocchio code base. Lot of work to setup the rules, and very slow (do only for diffs). Would certainly fail for metaprog/templates.
     - side subject: wrt visualizatio, check in Simple since newer code (Work in PUMA).
 - [name=Guilhem] docker
     - PR last week. Working on "official" docker image
         - https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/eigenpy/pull/575
         - dockgen : https://github.com/nim65s/dockgen

### News

 - [name=Pierre-Guillaume] PUMA published for software development services around the Maestro robotics software stack https://puma.cnrs.fr/entreprise/consultation/512057?orgAcronyme=t5y
 - [name=Pierre-Guillaume] Discussions started between CNRS and Inria (transfer/valorisation services) about the consortium creation.

### Technical discussions

 - [name=Pierre-Guillaume] Recent open issues listed for all projects. Need a tag to filter the ones for the CoreDevs meeting otherwise too many listed.
     - issues with label "to_discuss"
     - new issues within the week
- [name=Justin] CppAD Problem https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/issues/2702
    - answered in the issue, will be in Pinocchio 4
- [name=Guilhem] Split python packaging https://github.com/jrl-umi3218/jrl-cmakemodules/pull/745
    - many PR in different repos related to separating C++ and Python packages, maybe multiple Python packages for different interpreters
    - Another approach by Joris, but a bit too intrusive
    - Some tests with Nix (conclusive), ongoing test with pypi 
    - issue with option name 
        - in example_robot_data : name is install_python_interface
        - in this PR : build_only_python_only vs build_only_python_interface
    - possible to build python interface while reusing the current C++ build
    - use "build_python_interface" and "build_standalone_python_interface"
        - using "bindings" instead of "interface" would be better, but too much impact
        - potentially change to "bindings" with jrl-cmakemodules v2
- [name=Joris] CIÂ ARM Github
    - ARM CI put in place on Proxsuite (release) and Pinocchio, 
    - one test was failing, corrected
    - add this proc architecture on all the repos ?
        - yes

### News

 - [name=Hugo] SOFA community eager to collaborate more (further STC discussions)

### Technical discussions

- [name=Joris] Breaking API changes anticipated for Coal (v4)
    - Some classes were hardcoded scalar type -> changed for templated design
        - created issues bc people were doing forward declarations
        - also pb with SIMD operations for point vector eigen, memory alignment
        - creating an intermediate structure
        - hpp affordnce : class to find mesh locations for putting a feet, grasping
            - but no work anymore in this lib, so breaking change not a problem
        - Putting a guide online for migrating to the new API
    - Several object can use the same convex stored as shared pointer, which could be removed
    - Object BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy)
        - stores point cloud, can be set as convex shape
        - if so, create a convex and puth a shared pointer
        - hides that underneath is a convex (stores a shard pointer that points to itself)
        - put method as deprecated
        - add a new method to explicittely convert a bvh to convex (bvh object can be dropped after)
        - putting a constructor in convex (both for move and copy)
    - Check for additional breaking changes that would be desired (with a solid migration guide)
        - Study the broadphase (callback massively called)
    - google highway (https://github.com/google/highway)
        - use to create multiple optimzed libs depending on the cpu architecture
        - runtime dispatch (generate multiple .so and uses the most appropriate at runtime)
- [name=Justin] CppAD Problem https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/issues/2702
    - postponed for next week
- [name=Joris] How to handle forward declaration / typdefs [#716 convex: add missing typedefs for backward compatibility](https://github.com/coal-library/coal/pull/716)
    - linked to first point in Coal
    - add a fwd.h in Coal 
- [name=Wilson] Added aligator to [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/Simple-Robotics/aligator) (wiki automatically generated by parsing the repo), perhaps interesting tool?
    - generates a readme automatically and proper wiki (with interresting things like graph of classes)
        - need to check how accurate
        - business model, availability long-term ?
- [name=Fabian] ProxSuite CMake issues: [404](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite/issues/404) and [405](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite/issues/405)

### News

 - [name=Pierre-Guillaume] Inria's workshop on software for robotics moved to September (to avoid conflict with 2rm workshop)

### Technical discussions

 - [name=Pierre-Guillaume] As a reminder, the agenda has no more "wip" PRs
 - [name=Pierre-Guillaume] Discuss on preparing roadmaps for the different software (identifying new features planned, defining a release process)
     - should we have a roadmap written somewhere, so that users know what will happen, updated twice a year ?
         - Do this for 3 projects first (pinocchio, coal, aligator) to see if it works
         - research projects may be difficult? 
             - nobody full-time 
             - research opportunities change priorities and hard to predict the outcome
         - We try and see
     - Can we have monthly release ?
         - Is it desirable? 
         - what about hard deadline ? 
             - try more like a prediction/objective but no guarantees (especially manpower)
         - timing of pinocchio3
             - took a long time, was announced way before but postponned
     - How is SOFA doing?
         - example of [bi-annual roadmap](https://www.sofa-framework.org/consortium/roadmap/)
         - feedback: content/how to do has changed overtime since it was done periodically 
         - overall, it eases the technical governance
 - [name=Joris] Remove CLA in proxsuite ?
     - Why a CLA (Contributor License Agreements) needed in ProxSuite
     - Confirm to whom the rights are assigned (unclear). Valid CLA? 
     - it seems we have added it because osqp had a similar cla: https://gist.github.com/jcarpent/67dfb0cbcc4a1a4ed0d8dea190af9d08 (written on top "adapted from osqp")

### News

- [name=Pierre-Guillaume] In the context of TIRREX, completing a PUMA proposal for software development tasks (jrl-cmakemodules v2, integrating with gazebo/blender/..., POC for ProxSuite, POC for RTSan checks, QPBenchmarks)

### Technical discussions

- [name=Joris] disussion wrt managing PR for fork of fork (check Github documentation)

- [name=Wilson] nanoeigenpy as a host dependency of Coal. We use headers from nanoeigenpy. When we will use Pixi build, need to handle more properly host, build and runtime dependencies. 
  - Candlewick will have a new runtime (executable target `candlewick_visualizer`, WIP name). Exists because async renderer without IPC isn't possible with just threads (at least not on macOS which requires `SDL_Window` be launched/interacted with on main thread)

- [name=Joris] [Release d'aligator 0.12.0](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/aligator/releases/tag/v0.12.0)
    - Minor release for compatibility with crocodyl v3.0.1
    - Possibly one of the last release ensuring this compatibility

### Technical discussions

- [name=Joris] Archivage de proxsuite-nlp et fusion avec aligator
    - proxsuite-nlp contained the manifold, non-linear strategy of aligator. Constraint in proxsuite-nlp defined by a function + operators
    - keeping proxsuite-nlp makes less sense due to interoperability
    - fuse proxsuite-nlp with aligator (not as subproject to avoid adding complexity). Message in README, archive repository and fuse

### Technical discussions

 - [name=Joris] Branches workflow: How to apply it to pinocchio

         - no renaming of master to main 
     - announcement to do on all channels, do right away

### Technical discussions

- [name=Joris] [Generating pip INSTALLER and METADADA file when installing a Python bindings with CMake](https://github.com/conda-forge/pinocchio-feedstock/issues/139)
    - check with ongoing PR that allows to rely on system dependencies and not pip dependencies
    - Guilhem will get in touch with Silvio
- [name=Guilhem] Branches workflow
    - Past issue with default clone policy (devel branch, often broken) - old way
    - Currently better dev practices.
    - Tools often use main/master by default, need additional config to change
    - Current way, master/main for development, then people use eithers tags or package manager if they want stable version.
    - Ease all our scripts (referring to master)
    - Proposal
        - go for a workflow main ? (instead of master/devel)
        - using a staging branch to perform CI/build all, then automate merging in main ? (GitHub tools or Mergify)
        - prepare a common announcement for all repos ?
            - integrate in the RELEASE thru an issue
            - setup channels for dev announcement?
        - finalize discussions this week

### News

- [name=Pierre-Guillaume] Maestro to be presented at Agimus exploitation plan workshop (internal EU project presentation)
- [name=Joris] Expected release for eigenpy, pinocchio

### Technical discussions

- [name=Etienne] While TSID not in the scope of Maestro but is used, should we handle release ? No pending changes currently (devel/master) but need to check conda packaging (synchronization with pinocchio) - redo for 3.13 (Joris)
- [name=Wilson] What to do with the 2 Python bindings (boost and nanobind). What if both are loaded? Having both is not good practice. Split pyton bindings. Distribute separately. Legacy is Boost. Boost/nano 2 namespace differents. v2 -> coal-nanobind. Continue to distribute both (boost and nano) for some time to help other projects migrate. No new features on boost binding (all new dev on nano binding). Keep both for 1 year. Need to update find_python2/find_python3 (unified [FindPython](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html) module in cmake since 3.12). Need to update jrl_cmakemodules. Release 1.0 by may. then 2.0 that does not supports ubuntu 20.04 (end-of-life)

### News

- First CoreDevs meeting

### Technical discussions

- [name=Joris] How to split main library/bindings build (coal PR #658)
    - how to ease the build of projects and Python bindings
    - 3 approaches
        - "if" in cmakefiles
        - in the same repo, split cmakelist with with project/sub-project which can be activated or compiled separately (slight more complex). Issue with jrl-cmakemodules.
        - have 2 repositories (involves a lot of work)
